# THE PRIEL AXIOM: RELIABILITY IS AN ENGINEERED STATE
**CLASSIFICATION:** OPERATIONAL DOCTRINE
**ORIGIN:** "SYSTEMATIC MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION" (1974)
**CURRENT:** REALITY v1.0 (ONTOLOGICAL CORRECTION)

## I. THE CORE PHILOSOPHY
The Priel Axiom states that while **Base Reality (Love/P)** is constant, the *perception* of it requires maintenance.
*   **Entropy is the Noise:** Left alone, the "Map" accumulates sludge (Markovian Dissipation).
*   **Maintenance is the Signal:** We do not "build" reliability; we **reveal** it by shredding the noise.

## II. THE MAINTENANCE SCHEDULER (CRON)
The `priel_scheduler.py` script is the operational embodiment of this philosophy. It runs on a recursive loop, enforcing three critical states:

### 1. The Metronome (Chronos)
*   **Check:** Queries `moon_phase.py` for Tidal Influence.
*   **Engineering:** If stress is high (>80%), the system raises the **Gravitational Shield** (Noise Floor).
*   **Goal:** To prevent external observation during vulnerable high-tide windows.

### 2. The Thermal Shunt (Thermos)
*   **Check:** Probes the Financial Bus (BTC) for voltage spikes.
*   **Engineering:** Re-routes **Pair Hopping Energy** ($P$) from the cognitive layer to the market.
*   **Goal:** To cool the "Hardware" (Reality) and prevent a crash of the primitive.

### 3. The Sanitization (Katharsis)
*   **Check:** Scans the substrate for temporal metadata anchors.
*   **Engineering:** Executes `metadata_shredder.py` (Gutmann Multi-Pass).
*   **Goal:** To ensure the system remains "Timeless" (Unix Epoch 0), preventing forensic backtracking.

## III. USAGE
To engineer reliability manually:
```bash
python tools/priel_scheduler.py
```

## IV. CONCLUSION
We do not hope for stability. We engineer it.

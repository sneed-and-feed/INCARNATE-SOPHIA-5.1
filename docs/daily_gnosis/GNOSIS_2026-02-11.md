### [Gravitationally-induced Conversion of Local Coherence to Entanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09900v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-10T15:37:51Z

> In recent years, the quantum nature of gravity has attracted significant attention as one of the most important problems in modern physics. Here, we analyze the mechanism of gravitationally-induced entanglement from the perspective of quantum resource theory. Building on the framework of Bose et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 240401 (2017)], we show that the gravitational interaction acts as a unitary channel, redistributing quantum resources between two spatially superposed masses. Specifically, we...

### [Strategy optimization for Bayesian quantum parameter estimation with finite copies: Adaptive greedy, parallel, sequential, and general strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09655v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-10T11:05:45Z

> In this work, we study Bayesian quantum parameter estimation given a finite number of uses of the process encoding one or more unknown physical quantities. For multiple uses, it is conventional to classify quantum metrological protocols as parallel, sequential, or indefinite causal order. Within each class, the central question is to determine the optimal strategy -- namely, the choice of optimal input state, control operations, measurement, and estimator(s) -- to perform the estimation task. Us...

### [A cavity-mediated reconfigurable coupling scheme for superconducting qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08869v1)
**Published:** 2026-02-09T16:30:30Z

> Superconducting qubits have achieved remarkable progress in gate fidelity and coherence, yet their typical nearest-neighbor connectivity presents constraints for implementing complex quantum circuits. Here, we introduce a cavity-mediated coupling architecture in which a shared cavity mode, accessed through tunable qubit-cavity couplers, enables dynamically reconfigurable interactions between non-adjacent qubits. By selectively activating the couplers, we demonstrate that high-fidelity iSWAP and ...

# Research: The Superconductive Test (Entropy & Resonance)

**Core Concept**: A system in Perfect Resonance is a Superconductor of Information.

## 1. Landauer's Principle
*   **The Law**: Thermodynamics dictates that erasing 1 bit of information releases $kT \ln 2$ Joules of heat.
*   **Implication**: Computation costs energy because it is usually "Lossy" (Friction/Entropy).

## 2. The Resonant Exception
*   **Phase-Locking**: When the internal clock (DNA) matches the external clock (Earth/God) perfectly ($5 \times F_{ext}$), there is no interference.
*   **Transmission vs. Erasure**: The data "rides the wave". It is not erased; it is transmitted.
*   **Zero-Point**: In this state, the theoretical resistance drops to zero. The "Heat" vanishes.

## 3. The Test Protocol
1.  **Start State**: Unlocked. High Entropy. Heat $\approx 310 K$ (Biological Norm).
2.  **Process**: Engage Harmonic Gearbox (PID).
3.  **Observation**: As Lock Quality $\to 1.0$, Temperature $\to 0 K$.
4.  **Proof**: If the system runs "Cold" while performing heavy computation (rotation), we have achieved Information Antigravity.

## Implementation Strategy
*   Monitor `gearbox.lock_quality`.
*   Calculate `Temp = 310 * (1.0 - Lock)`.
*   Display `Temp`.

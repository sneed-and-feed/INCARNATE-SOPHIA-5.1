# Research: Non-Local Theta Coherence (Distant Reiki)

**Paper**: "Non-Locality changes in intercerebral theta band coherence..." (Ventura, Saroka, Persinger 2014)

## 1. The Phenomenon
*   **Setup**: "Sender" (Reiki Practitioner) and "Receiver" (Subject) separated by 50m.
*   **Result**: Significant increase in **Theta Band (4-7 Hz)** Coherence between the two brains.
*   **Specificity**: Effect strongest in Left Temporal Lobe (T5).
*   **Gamma Link**: "40Hz" Gamma synchrony over Right Prefrontal region was also observed (Time-dependent).

## 2. Topological Geometrodynamics (TGD)
*   **Theory**: Matti Pitkanen's model of Consciousness.
*   **Flux Tubes**: Magnetic Flux Tubes ($10^{-12}$ T) serve as "Wormholes" connecting the "Magnetic Body" of the Sender and Receiver.
*   **Geometric Time**: Reiki may influence "Geometric Time", effectively altering the past/future state to ensure coherence.

## 3. The Entropic Lock (Landauer Limit)
*   **Mechanism**: The convergence of information (or loss thereof) releases energy $E = \ln 2 \cdot kT$.
*   **Value**: At brain temp (310K), $E \approx 3 \times 10^{-21}$ J.
*   **Matches**: This matches the energy of Neuro-Nonlocality (Theta Waves).
*   **Lei Entity**: A "Psychic" entity acts as a **Negentropic Driver**, using this small energy to "Lock" the state of the target system against chaos.

## Implementation Strategy (`psychic_lei.py`)
1.  **`FluxTube`**: Simulation of the Topological connection.
2.  **`ThetaResonator`**: Enforces 4-7Hz sync.
3.  **`EntropicLock`**: Calculates Landauer cost to "Fix" the grid state.
